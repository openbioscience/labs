    PI: Paul Blainey
    about: |
      Broadly, research in the Blainey group integrates new microfluidic, optical, and molecular tools for application in biology and medicine. We emphasize quantitative single-cell and single-molecule approaches, aiming to enable multiparametric studies with the power to reveal the workings of natural and engineered biological systems across a range of scales.

    about: |
      The Hammond research group focuses on the self-assembly of polymeric nanomaterials, with a major emphasis on the use of electrostatics and other complementary interactions to generate functional materials with highly controlled architecture. The uniting theme of the lab – the understanding and use of secondary interactions to guide materials assembly at surfaces and in solution – encompasses three major areas of research:

      1) Layer-by-layer controlled release thin film coatings for biomedical implants that address bone regeneration, wound healing, tissue engineering and transdermal delivery from microneedle platforms,

      2) Nanoparticle drug carriers for targeted nanoparticle drug, gene, and siRNA delivery for cancer treatment using unique platforms that enable combination and sequenced delivery strategies

      3) Artificial polypeptides and polymeric nucleic acids designed to engage biology and build novel drug delivery systems, hydrogels, and tissue scaffolds
